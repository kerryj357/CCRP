    <h2>About CCRP</h2>
    <p>
    <h1>CCRP</h1>
<p>
CCRP is a decentralized digital token designed to support Caribbean culture,
art, and people, while enabling transparent peer-to-peer transfers within
blockchain-based ecosystems.
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>About CCRP</h2>
<p>
CCRP operates as a utility-focused token deployed on a public blockchain.
It is intended for use in environments that require verifiable transactions,
open participation, and on-chain execution.
</p>
<p>
CCRP does not represent ownership, equity, profit-sharing, or voting rights
in any company, protocol, or organization.
</p>
<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>Cultural Manifesto</h2>
<p>
CCRP is rooted in Caribbean culture — a culture shaped by resilience,
creativity, rhythm, and shared history. It represents a commitment to
visibility, participation, and digital inclusion for Caribbean people
and the global diaspora.
</p>

<p>
The Caribbean has long influenced the world through music, art, sport,
language, and innovation. CCRP exists to acknowledge that contribution
and to support cultural expression within modern, decentralized systems.
</p>

<p>
CCRP is not a promise of wealth or ownership. It is a utility token designed
to enable participation, experimentation, and transparent interaction
within blockchain-based ecosystems that value openness and accessibility.
</p>

<p>
This project stands for cultural respect, technological neutrality,
and community-driven growth. CCRP is an evolving digital tool — shaped
by use, creativity, and responsible participation — rather than speculation
or centralized control.
